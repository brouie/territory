# Territory: Lore

## The Shattered Expanse

The world known as the Expanse was once a single landmass, held together by trade routes and treaties. That order collapsed. What remains is a patchwork of territories, each contested, each worth something to whoever can hold it.

No central authority enforces the rules. Control is established by force, maintained by presence. The chain records who holds what. The rest is negotiation, threat, and calculation.

## The Map

Locations across the Expanse are nodes on a network. Some are resource-rich, others strategic. Movement between them follows fixed paths. You cannot cross from one territory to another without passing through what lies between. That constraint shapes every campaign.

Ownership of a location grants rights: to fortify, to harvest, to deny passage. It also makes you a target. Unheld land is easier to take but often harder to defend.

## Units and Power

Units are raised from Gold and materials. Higher-tier units cost more but deliver more power per head. Power in combat is a product of level and numbers. No dice. No hidden factors. What you deploy is what decides the outcome.

Defenders hold an advantage when power is equal. Attackers must bring more to win. That asymmetry rewards preparation and punishes recklessness.

## The Economy

Every action on the chain costs a fee. A share of that fee flows to the treasury. Another share is sent to buy and burn CL8Y, reducing its supply over time. The design is transparent: you pay to act, and part of that payment is permanently removed from circulation.

Gold circulates within the game. BNB circulates at its borders. The two meet at deposit, withdrawal, and fee collection.

## Factions and Identity

Players are identified by address. Names, alliances, and rivalries exist offchain. The chain does not care. It enforces movement rules, combat outcomes, and fee splits. Everything else is convention, chat, and reputation.

Some players focus on expansion. Others defend. Some trade. The mechanics support all of it. The lore is what you and others make of the territories you hold.
