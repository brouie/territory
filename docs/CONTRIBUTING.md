# Contributing to Territory

This document explains how to contribute to the project.

## Reporting Issues

Open an issue for bugs, unclear documentation, or feature requests. Include steps to reproduce for bugs. For feature requests, describe the problem you are trying to solve.

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch from `main` for your change.
3. Make your edits. Follow the existing style: no emojis in code or docs, direct prose.
4. Run `forge test` in `contracts/` before submitting. All tests should pass.
5. Open a pull request. Describe what changed and why.

## Code Style

- Solidity: follow the patterns in existing contracts. Use `forge fmt` before committing.
- TypeScript/React: use the existing structure. Avoid unnecessary abstraction.
- Markdown: plain language, no emojis, no marketing filler.
